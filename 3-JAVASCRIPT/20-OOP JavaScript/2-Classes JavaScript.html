JavaScript Classes

- In computer programming class is reffered as "Program Template".
- A template comprises of data and logic, which you can customize and implement according to your requirements.
- A class have the behaviour of "Entity" when it maps to business requirements.
- A class have the behaviour of "Model" when it maps to data requirements.
- A class acts as "Blue Print" for all its instances. [Objects]

Class Configuration:
- You can configure class using 2 methods

        a) Declaration
        b) Expression

Syntax: Declaration

    class   Name
    {
    }

Syntax: Expression

    let   Name =  class {
    }

Class Members:
- A class allows only following members

    1. Property
    2. Accessor
    3. Method
    4. Constructor

FAQ's:
1. Can we have a variable in class?
A. Yes. But it can't be class member.

2. Why we can't have variable as class member?
A. Variables are immutable, can't change the configuration according to state and situation. But class is a template, which means every member must allow customization.
     Class can have only mutable members, that allow customization. Hence variable can't be a class member.

                   
                               Property
                               -------------
- A property is used to store data.
- A property can store any type of data
    a) Primitive
    b) Non Primitive
    c) Date
    d) Map
    e) Regular Expression

Syntax:
    class Name
    {
      Property = value;
    }

- Properties are mutable types, they can change the behaviour according to state and situation.

- Properties are accessed within class by using "this" keyword.
- Properties are accessed outside class by using instance (object) of class.

Syntax:
        let  obj = new ClassName();
        obj.Property

- ClassName()  refers to a constructor, which is default in a class.
- Constructor allows to create an object for class. So that you can access the class members using object of class. [instance of class]
- You can read or write data into a property directly.

        obj.Property = value;        => write
        obj.Property;                => read

- A property returns "undefined" if value is not defined.
- It is same like a variable in JavaScript, it is implicitly typed.
- Property is mutable, it can change the structure according to the situation.
