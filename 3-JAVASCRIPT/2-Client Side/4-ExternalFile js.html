3. JavaScript in External file
- You can configure JavaScript functions in a script file with extention ".js".
- You can link script file by using <script> token.
- Functions in external file can be accessed from any page.
- You can reuse across pages.
- However using external file will increase the number of requests and also page load time.


Ex:
- Add a new file into "src"  by name "print.js"

     "use strict";
        
            function PrintPage(){
            window.print();
            }    
        

- Go to HTML page and link script file

    <script src="../src/scripts/print.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>

    <button onclick="PrintPage()"> Print </button>

FAQ: How JavaScript refers HTML elements?
Ans: JavaScript provides various reference techniques for developer in order to access HTML elements from page and handle dynamic interactions.

1. JavaScript can refer HTML elements by using BOM hierarchy
      [Browser Object Model]

- It is the native method for browser.
- Hence it is faster.
- Refering using BOM hierarchy requires lot of index reference, which you have to update everytime when element position changes in page.

Syntax:
        window.document.images[]
        window.document.forms[].elements[]
