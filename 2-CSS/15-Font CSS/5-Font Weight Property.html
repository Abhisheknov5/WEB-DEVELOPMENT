CSS font-weight Property :-

The font-weight property of the CSS is used to set the weight or thickness of the font being used with the HTML Text.
The font-weight applied will depend on font-family used and the browser. For instance, some font-family is available only in specific weights.

Syntax:

font-weight: normal|bold|lighter|bolder|number|initial|inherit|unset;
Property Values:

normal: This is the default font-weight & defines the normal font-weight. It is equal to the number value 400.
bold: This defines the bold font-weight, it is equal to the number value 700.
lighter: This makes the font-weight one level lighter than the parent element, considering the available font weights of the font family.
bolder: This makes the font-weight one level heavier than the parent element, considering the available font weights of the font family.
number: This sets the font-weight according to the number specified. The number can range between 1 to 1000. If the exact weight is unavailable, a suitable weight is applied.

Global Values:

initial: This sets the font-weight to the initial(default) value.
inherit: This sets the font-weight equal to the value inherited from its parent element.
unset: This sets the font-weight equal to the value inherited from its parent element since font-weight is an inheritable property.
