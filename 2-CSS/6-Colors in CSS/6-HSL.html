<!--
(5) HSL:- It is a short form of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Let's understand them individually.
Hue: It can be defined as the degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 represents red, 120 represents green, 240 represents blue.
Saturation: It takes value in percentage in which 100% represents fully saturated, i.e., no shades of gray, 50% represent 50% gray, but the color is still visible, and 0% represents fully unsaturated, i.e., completely gray, and the color is invisible.
Lightness: The lightness of the color can be defined as the light that we want to provide the color in which 0% represents black (there is no light), 50% represents neither dark nor light, and 100% represents white (full lightness).
Syntax:
color:hsl(H, S, L);
