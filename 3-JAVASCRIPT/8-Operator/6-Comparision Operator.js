(1) Comparison Operators:-

- Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

- Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:

Operator	Description	    Comparing	        Returns	Try it
==	         equal to	     x == 8	                 false	
                             x == 5	                 true	
                             x == "5"	             true	
===	equal value and equal type	x === 5              true	
x === "5"	false	
!=	not equal	x != 8	true	
!==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
x !== "5"	true	
x !== 8	true	
>	greater than	x > 8	false	
<	less than	x < 8	true	
>=	greater than or equal to	x >= 8	false	
<=	less than or equal to	x <= 8	true

How Can it be Used
Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result:

if (age < 18) text = "Too young to buy alcohol";
