CSS SELECTOR:-
CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.
There are several different types of selectors in CSS.
       (1) CSS Element Selector
       (2) CSS Id Selector
       (3) CSS Class Selector
       (4) CSS Universal Selector
       (5) CSS Group Selector

(1) CSS Element Selector:-
- This is the simplest type of selector.
- It selects all HTML elements of a specified type. For example, if you use p as a selector, it will select and style all <p> elements on your webpage.
Syntax: elementname { /* styles */ }
Example:-
p { color: blue; }

(2) CSS ID Selector:-
- This selects an HTML element with a specific id attribute value.
- IDs must be unique within a page, so this selector is used for selecting a single, specific element.
Syntax: #idname { /* styles */ }
Example:-
#header { background-color: gray; }

(3) CSS Class Selector:-
- This selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute value.
- Classes can be used on multiple elements, so this selector is used to style multiple elements with the same class.
Syntax: .classname { /* styles */ }
Example:-
.highlight { font-weight: bold; }

(4) CSS Universal Selector:-
- This selects all elements on the page.
- It's denoted by an asterisk (*).
- It's used when you want to apply styles globally to all elements, but it's often avoided because it can lead to unintended consequences.
Syntax: * { /* styles */ }
Example:-
* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }

(5) CSS Group Selector:-
- This selector allows you to apply the same styles to multiple selectors at once.
- You group selectors together by separating them with commas.
Syntax: selector1, selector2, selector3 { /* shared styles */ }
Example:-
 h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
