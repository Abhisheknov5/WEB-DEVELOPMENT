JavaScript OOP:-

- Real world application development uses various programming techniques like

    a) POPS
    b) OBPS
    c) OOPS

POPS
- Process Oriented Programming System
- It supports low level features.
- It can directly interact with hardware services.
- It uses less memory.
- It is faster in interactions.

Ex: C, Pascal
- It doesn't support dynamic memory
- It is hard to reuse and extend
- It have separation issues

OBPS
- Object Base Programming System
- It enables dynamic memory
- It supports reusability
- It supports code separation
- It supports extensibility

Ex: JavaScript, Visual Basic
- No dynamic polymorphism
- No code level security
- Extensibility issues


OOPS
- Object Oriented Programming System
- Code reusability
- Code separation
- Dynamic Polymorphism
- Code level security
- Code Abstraction

Ex: C++, Java, C#

- They will not support low level features
- They can't directly interact with hardware services
- They require more memory
- They slow in interactions
- They are heavy on application.


Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language. It supports only few features of OOP.

Evolution OOP:
- "Alan Kay" introduced the concept of Object into computer programming.
- Object is used to keep all related data and logic together.
- In early 1967, Johan Olay & Kristian Nygaard introduced the concept of OOP with a language called "SIMULA".
- It enables code reusability.
- In early 1970's Trygve introduced code separation
- Trygve introduced MVC [Model View Controller]. => Small Talk Language

        Java        Spring MVC
        Python    Django, Flask, Grock
        PHP        Cake PHP, Code Igniter
        Ruby    Ruby on Rails
        .NET    ASP.NET MVC
        JavaScript  SPINE
- In early 1970's  C++
- In early 1990's  Java
- In early 2000  C#

                        JavaScript OOP Features

Modules
- A module comprises of data and logic.
- JavaScript module comprises of variables, functions and classes.
- It allows resuability and separation.
- JavaScript module system requires a special compiling technique, which is supported of module systems like
        a) Common JS
        b) Require JS
        c) UMD  (Universal Module Distribution)
        d) AMD (Asynchronous Module Distribution)
        e) ES Module etc..
- If you are using module system with javascript in browser, then the default module system is "ES Module".
- You have to define the script type as "module" in order to use module system in browser.

        <script  type="module">
   
        </script>

- Every JavaScript file ".js" is considered as a module.
- Typically module comprises of variables, functions and classes.
- Every variable, function or class defined in module is not accessible outside module.
- Hence you have to mark it as "export". The members that are required to access from another module need to be marked as "export".

Syntax:
      export function  Home()
      {
      }

- Every class can have one default export. [only one export can be defined as default]
- "default" defines that the function will use "eager" loading technique, which means the function will load by default into memory, even if it is not in use.
- The function, which is not marked as default will use "Lazy loading". It loads into memory only when it is in use.
- In order to use any function from a module, you have to import into HTML page.

Syntax:
       import   { functionName }  from  "moduleName.js";
       import   defaultFuncionName   from "moduleName.js";

- It is mandatory to import all default members before non-default

Syntax:
       import   { functionName }, defaultName  from  "moduleName.js";   //invalid

       import  defaultName, { functionName}  from  "moduleName.js";     // valid

       import   { function1, function2, ... }   from  "moduleName.js";

       import  *  as  refName  from  "moduleName.js";

Ex:
1. Add a new folder into project by name  "library".

2. Add a new file into library by name

        "MathModule.js"


var title = "Math Functions";

export default function Addition(x, y){
    return x + y;
}

export  function PrintTitle(){
    return title;
}

3. Add HTML page to access and use module

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script type="module">

        import  Addition, { PrintTitle } from "../library/MathModule.js";

        document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = `<h2>${PrintTitle()}</h2>Addition=${Addition(40,20)}`;

    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p></p>
</body>
</html>

FAQ's:
1. Where to change the Module System?
A. In configuration file, generated with bundlers and lint tools.
       
        Lint        =>  eslint, tslint, pmd, sonar etc..
        Bundler    => webpack, parceljs, vitejs

2. Where to change the JavaScript version for project?
A. In configuration files
