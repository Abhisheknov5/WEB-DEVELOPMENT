CSS COLOR:-
CSS Color property is used to set the color of HTML elements. This property is used to set font color, background color, etc. The color of an element can be defined in the following ways:
(1) Built-In Color
(2) RGB Format
(3) RGBA Format
(4) Hexadecimal Notation
(5) HSL
(6) HSLA
(7) TEXT COLOR
(8) BACKGROUND COLOR
(8) BORDER COLOR

(1) Built-In Color:- These are a set of predefined colors which are used by its name. For example: red, blue, green etc.
Syntax:
h1 {
  color: color-name;
}

(2) RGB Format:- The RGB(Red, Green, Blue) format is used to define the color of an HTML element by specifying the R, G, B values range between 0 to 255. For example: RGB value of Red color is (255, 0, 0), Green color is (0, 255, 0), Blue color is (0, 0, 255) etc.
Syntax:
h1 {
 color: rgb(R, G, B);
}

(3) RGBA Format:- The RGBA format is similar to the RGB, but the difference is RGBA contains A (Alpha) which specifies the transparency of elements. The value of alpha lies between 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0. represents fully transparent and 1.0 represents not transparent.
Syntax:
h1 {
 color:rgba(R, G, B, A);
}

(4) Hexadecimal Notation:- The hexadecimal notation begins with # symbol followed by 6 characters each ranging from 0 to F. For example: Red #FF0000, Green #00FF00, Blue #0000FF etc.
Syntax:
h1 {
 color:#(0-F)(0-F)(0-F)(0-F)(0-F)(0-F);
}

(5) HSL:- It is a short form of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Let's understand them individually.
Hue: It can be defined as the degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 represents red, 120 represents green, 240 represents blue.
Saturation: It takes value in percentage in which 100% represents fully saturated, i.e., no shades of gray, 50% represent 50% gray, but the color is still visible, and 0% represents fully unsaturated, i.e., completely gray, and the color is invisible.
Lightness: The lightness of the color can be defined as the light that we want to provide the color in which 0% represents black (there is no light), 50% represents neither dark nor light, and 100% represents white (full lightness).
Syntax:
color:hsl(H, S, L); 

(6) HSLA:- The HSLA color property is similar to HSL property, but the difference is HSLA contains A (Alpha) which specifies the transparency of elements. The value of alpha lies between 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0. represents fully transparent and 1.0 represents not transparent.
Syntax:
h1 {
 color:hsla(H, S, L, A);
}

(7) Text Color: It is used to set the color of the text.
Syntax:
h1 {
color:color_name;
}

(8) Background Color:- It is used to set the background color of an HTML element.
Syntax:
h1 {
  background-color:color_name;
}

(9) Border Color:- It is used to set the border color of an element. Border-style is used to set the border type.
Syntax:
h1 {
border-style:solid/dashed/dotted
border-color:color_name;
}
