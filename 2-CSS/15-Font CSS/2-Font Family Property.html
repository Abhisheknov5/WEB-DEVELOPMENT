CSS font-family Property:-

The font-family property specifies the font of an element.
It can have multiple fonts as a backup system i.e. if the browser doesn’t support one font then the other can be used.
In other words, this property is used to specifies the family-name &/or generic-family, based on the priority from the list, for the selected element.

The font-family can be categorized into 2 types:

family-name: It contains the name of a font-family, such as “times”, “courier”, “arial”, etc.
generic-family: It contains name of a generic-family, such as”serif”, “sans-serif”, “cursive”, “fantasy”, “monospace”.
Syntax: 

element_selector {
    font-family: family-name|generic-family|initial|inherit;
} 
Property values:

fonts-name: This specifies the name of the font in quotes separated by commas.
generic-family: It is used to set the font of text in an HTML document from the list of available fonts from the font pool.
initial: It is used to set an element’s CSS property to its default value.
inherit: It is used to inherit a property to an element from its parent element property value.
Note: The font-name can be declared with the single quotes when using the style attribute in the HTML & also it must be quoted when it contains white space.

We will understand the usage of the font-family property by implementing it.

Example: This example illustrates the use of the font-family property.
