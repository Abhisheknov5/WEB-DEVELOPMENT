JavaScript

- JavaScript is light weight interpretted and JIT [Just-in-Time] compiled programming language.

Explaination:
- Light weight defines that it occupies less memory space.
- Interpretted defines that it is translated line by line.
- Compiled defines that it translates all lines in program simultaneously at the same time.
- There are 2 types of compiling techniques
   
        a) JIT [Just-in-Time]
        b) AOT [Ahead-of-Time]

- JIT compiles the code in browser.
- AOT compiles the code at application level. It allows to render faster.

- JavaScript is a language that supports various programming approaches like
    a) functional
    b) structural
    c) imperative
    d) object based
    e) object oriented etc..

  Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language.

- JavaScript is a language, which is used

    a) Client Side                [HTML]
    b) Server Side                [Node JS, Express JS]
    c) In Database            [MongoDB]
    d) In Animations etc..        [Flash, Action Script]

FAQ: What is the role of JavaScript Client Side?
Ans:
 - JavaScript is used client side to reduce burden on server.
 - It reduces burden by managing iteractions client side.
 - JavaScript is used client side for

        a) BOM [Browser Object Model] Interactions
        b) DOM [Document Object Model] Manipulations
        c) Validations etc..
- BOM Includes
    a) location
    b) history
    c) navigator
    d) document etc..
- DOM Includes
    a) Data Binding
    b) Style Binding
    c) Class Binding
    d) Model Binding
    e) Adding and Removing elements from DOM etc..
- Validations ensure that contradictionary and unauthorized data is not get stored into database.

Evolution of JavaScript:
- In early 1970's  CERN labs designed a script language called ECMA Script for Network.
- ECMA Script is used in Internet applications.
- Mosaic is the first browser used for Internet, which used ECMA Script for client side interactions.
- In early 1995 "Netscape Communications" introduced a browser called "Netscape Communicator".
- Netscape appointed "Brendan Eich" to design a script for their browser.
- Brendan Eich designed a script by name "Mocha".
- Later Mocha renamed to "Live Script".
- Sun micro system took responsibility of maintaining Live Script and named it as
    "JavaScript".

- Mocha
- Live Script
- JavaScript
- In early 2000  Netscape stopped its services and handed over JavaScript to a community "ECMA".
- ECMA started versions for JavaScript by name
        ECMA Script 2015  [ES5]
                      2016  [ES6]
                      ........
                      2022  [ES2022]

FAQ: How to check the status of JavaScript in browser?
Ans : By using HTML element <noscript>.

Syntax:
    <body>
        <noscript> please enable JavaScript on your browser </noscript>
    </body>

Issues with JavaScript:
- JavaScript is not a strongly typed language.
       
        var x = 10;        // x is integer
        x = "John";        // valid

- JavaScript is not implicitly strictly typed language.

FAQ: What is difference between strongly typed and strictly typed?
Ans : Strongly typed is verifying data type
     Strictly typed is verifying programming rules.

- JavaScript is not an OOP language, It supports only few features of OOP.

- Extensibility Issues

- Code Level Security Issues

What is Solution?
- TypeScript

Developer writes in Typescript => Transcompiled into => JavaScript  => Browser

What is a script?
- A script is bound to the actions in a presentation.
- It defines the actions to performs and sets restrictions for actions to perform.
- JavaScript is a script to control HTML and CSS presentations in browser.

Integrating JavaScript Client Side:
1. Inline JavaScript
2. Embedded JavaScript
3. External File
