            Books are undeniably a blessing to humankind. And books being useful for us in many ways have earned the title of our best friend. Libraries are the storehouse of books of several genres where interested readers can spend time reading in silence or can borrow books by being a member of that library. Through this practice of reading, we humans also display a greater sense of being civilized.

            There are individuals like myself who like to collect books, especially storybooks or novels. And this habit of mine has turned my house into a small library in itself. I know many other readers who share this same obsession with reading books and collecting them. My conversions with them mostly revolve around the plot, the character development, the writing style of the authors, and other aspects of books.
            The endless source of knowledge, information, entertainment, and training are books. Before the age of the internet, books were the most dominating source of knowledge. But of course, with technology, the forms of books have changed, and books have become more accessible to everyone.

In the education system, books are mostly followed to date for knowledge providing and gain. Books on several subjects enhance several aspects of education and learning.

            The companionship factor of books is one of the most delightful things as they are also tagged as an individualâ€™s best friend. And as we say that book home every solution a person might ever need.

           The first existence of books was observed in Egypt, with pages made of papyrus leaves or animal skins and cover made of wood. But they were handwritten books. In the age of handwritten books, the task of writing was very laborious and took a long time for copiers to make other copies of one book. Then came the block printing era of books in 220 AD and was introduced by China. Long after that came, the mechanical printing press was discovered, the modern version we use now.
