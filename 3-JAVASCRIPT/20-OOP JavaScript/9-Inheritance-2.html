<!--
Types of Inheritance:-

   a) Single Inheritance
   b) Multi Level Inheritance

- Any inheritance implementation must follow a basic rule:
 
  "A super class constructor must be called first then followed by dervied class constructor"

- In JavaScript inheritance rule is not implemented implicitly. You have to manually implement by calling the super class constructor in derived class.

- You can call super constructor in derived by using "super()".

<script>
    // Define a class named SuperClass
    class SuperClass
    {
        // Constructor of SuperClass
        constructor(){
            document.write("Super Class constructor<br>");
        }
    }
    // Define a class named DerivedClass that extends SuperClass
    class DerivedClass extends SuperClass
    {
         // Constructor of DerivedClass
        constructor(){
            super(); // Call the constructor of the superclass (SuperClass)
            document.write("Derived Class constructor");
        }
    }
    // Create an instance of DerivedClass, which will invoke its constructor
    let obj = new DerivedClass();
</script>
