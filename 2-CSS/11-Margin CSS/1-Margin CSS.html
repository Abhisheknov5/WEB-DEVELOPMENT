CSS Margin :-
CSS Margin is the space outside an element, separating it from other elements. It adds space around an element, affecting its positioning and creating gaps between other elements.

CSS provides properties to specify the margin for each side of an element individually.

margin-top: Sets the margin space above the element.
margin-right: Sets the margin space to the right of the element.
margin-bottom: Sets the margin space below the element.
margin-left: Sets the margin space to the left of the element.
Margin properties can have the following values:

Length in cm, px, pt, etc.
Width % of the element.
Margin calculated by the browser: auto.
 

Syntax:

.myDiv {
    margin-top: 80px;
    margin-right: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
    margin-left: 80px;
}
