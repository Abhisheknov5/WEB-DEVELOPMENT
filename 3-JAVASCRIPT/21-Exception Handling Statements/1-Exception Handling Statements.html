    Exception Handling Statements

- In computer programming developers encounter with 2 types of errors.

        1. Compile Time Errors
        2. Run Time Errors

- Compile Time Errors are syntactical errors, due to which a program files to execute.
- A syntactical error can be keyword errors, block error, scope error, order dependency error etc.
- Run time error occurs while using the application.
- Run time error is the inability of compiler system to understand the instructions given to application.
- Run time error leads to "Abnormal Termination" of application.
- You can prevent abnormal termination by using exception handling.
- Exception handling statements are

        a) try            : monitoring block
        b) catch            : handler block
        c) throw            : throws exception explicitly
        d) finally            : executes always

Syntax:-
    try
    {
       statements to execute;
    }
    catch(exception)
    {
       report the exception if any statements fails;
    }
    finally
    {
      statements to execute always;
    }

Note: "throw" exception while executing statements, that is in "try" block.

<script>
  try 
  {
    var a = parseInt(prompt("Enter Number-1"));
    var b = parseInt(prompt("Enter Number-2"));
    if(b==0) {
      throw "Divide By Zero Error: Can not Divide by Zero";
    }
    if(b>a){
      throw "Error: Can not Divide a Larger Number";
    }
    var c = a / b;
    document.write(`Division=${c}`);
  }
  catch(error)
  {
    document.write(error + "<br>");
  }
  finally {
    document.write("Program End");
  }
</script>
