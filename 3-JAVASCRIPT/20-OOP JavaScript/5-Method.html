   Method
- A method defines actions to be performed by object.
- Class can store all actions using method.
- In traditional programming
        function        => always returns
        method        => always void
        procedure    => changes from void to return & vice versa

- You can't define function as class member, but it can be inside class.
- Class allows methods as members.
- JavaScript class method have the behaviour of both method and function.

Syntax:
    class Name
    {
        Method1(params)
        {
        }
        Method2()
        {
        return value;
        }
        }

FAQ: Why function is not allowed as class member?

<script>
    class Product // Define a class named Product
    {
        Name = "Samsung Tv"; // Default name for the product
        Price = 45000.33; // Default price for the product
        Qty = 0; // Default quantity for the product

        // Method to calculate the total price of the product
        Total(){
            return this.Qty * this.Price;
        }
         // Method to print the product details
        Print(){
            // Print the name, price, quantity, and total price of the product
            document.write(`Name=${this.Name}<br>Price=${this.Price}<br>Qty=${this.Qty}<br>Total=${this.Total()}`);
        }
    }
    // Create a new instance of the Product class
    let obj = new Product();

    // Prompt the user to enter the quantity of the product
    obj.Qty = parseInt(prompt("Enter Product Quantity"));

    // Print the product details
    obj.Print();
